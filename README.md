# Climate_Planner_AI
Climate‑Plan AI turns ultra‑local sensor data (every 100–250 m) into live heat, air‑quality, and fire‑risk alerts displayed on an interactive map and dashboard. An AI planner layer translates those raw metrics into clear next‑step recommendations for individuals, schools, or enterprises.
